Board Game System: Implementation and Analysis Using OOP and Database Integration," develops an interactive platform for classic board games like Tic Tac Toe, Checkers, and Snake and Ladders. Using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, the project ensures modular, maintainable, and scalable code. The system features a Tkinter-based graphical user interface (GUI) in Python and integrates SQLite for persistent storage, managing user data and game history.
The Tic Tac Toe module offers a 3x3 grid for two-player gameplay, the Checkers module simulates an 8x8 board with basic piece movements, and the Snake and Ladders module incorporates dice rolls, ladders, and snakes. The project emphasizes OOP concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism to streamline game logic and enhance code reuse. Features like user registration, login, and game history tracking improve the user experience.
